# Summary DataFrame write-up
## Urban
From a high level, the Urban market generates nearly ⅔ the total fare revenue. Given the density of “locations” in a city, it’s not surprising that the average fare per ride is the least (nearly ⅔ the rural fare) and ⅚ the suburban fare. What stands out is Fare per driver of $0.67. This suggests that there is a saturation of drivers in the urban market, i.e. supply outstrips demand. Though not provided in the table, for every ride, there are >36 drivers for every ride. 

## Suburban
The Suburban market generates half the revenue of the Urban market with 25% higher average fare than the Urban market and nearly 90% the average Rural fare. From a driver’s vantage point, it’s a less competitive market compared to the the Urban region. Drivers can expect nearly 4x as much per fare ($2.26/fare) than the Urban drivers ($0.67). Comparing rides provided and drivers, there are 13 drivers for every ride overall. 
## Rural
The Rural market is a driver’s market as it provides the highest fare per ride and drivers can expect over $8 per driver. The issue is that only 125 rides were provided over the four-month period so it would be a challenging prospect to grow a company from a market that generated less than $4,500 in the first third of the year. 


# Multi-line Graph Summary

## Urban
Largest market, more volatility than the other markets, but also finishing higher than where started
Choppiness with ever-decreasing lows and highs from late February to late March  would require deeper analysis to determine root causes as this is not evident in the Suburban and Rural markets. 

## Suburban
Faces some fare resistance on the bottom side (lows are not getting worse, or better but instead fairly consistent)
Seeing some stability from mid-March to the end of April with less volatlity
Generating fare revenue at end of April nearly 2x beginning of january. 
Started as less than half the size of Rural and finished nearly 60% of Urban market 
Seeing the most positive trend in the final month compared to other markets

## Rural
Smallest market
While fare volume experiences some ups and downs, there is little sustained growth from January to the end of April and the last week (end of April) in the period generates just as much revenue as the first week (January) 

## Other considerations
For a deeper analysis, one could compare rides to time while incorporating another factor like temperature/precipitation/days of the week. Assuming all cities (Urban and otherwise) are all northern hemisphere, we are looking at late-winter/early-spring. Seasonality could play a significant factor on ride volume. 
Another segmentation is considering rides per time-of-day while looking at drivers available. This could help drivers determine when they might want to schedule shifts so there is less competition but still adequate rider demand.
